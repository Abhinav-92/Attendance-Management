# Attendance-Management

## This is a simple Employees Attendance Tracker web app.

This project involves building an attendance system which utilizes facial recognition to mark the presence, time-in, and time-out of employees. It covers areas such as facial detection, alignment, and recognition, along with the development of a web application to cater to various use cases of the system such as registration of new employees, addition of photos to the training dataset, viewing attendance reports, etc. This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in corporate offices, schools, and organizations where security is essential.


It is a functional prototype of what I wanted to create.

## The system mainly works around 2 types of users

1. Employee
2. Admin

## Following functionalities can be performed by the admin:
• Login

• Register new employees to the system

• Add employee photos to the training data set

• Train the model

• View attendance report of all employees. Attendance can be filtered by date or employee.

## Following functionalities can be performed by the employee:
• Login

• Mark his/her time-in and time-out by scanning their face

• View attendance report of self



## Face Detection
Dlib's HOG facial detector.

## Facial Landmark Detection
Dlib's 68 point shape predictor
